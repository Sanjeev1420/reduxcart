# ShopEasy!

ShopEasy! is a simple e-commerce web application built with React and Bootstrap. It allows users to view a list of products, add them to the shopping cart, and proceed to the payment page.

## Components

### 1. App

The `App` component serves as the main entry point for the application. It provides the global state using the `CartContext` and renders the `Header` and `Cart` components.

### 2. Header

The `Header` component displays the navigation bar at the top of the page. It includes the logo, brand name, navigation links, and a shopping cart icon that shows the total number of items in the cart.

### 3. Cart

The `Cart` component is responsible for rendering the shopping cart page. It uses the `CartItem` and `PriceCard` components to display individual items in the cart and the total price details.

### 4. CartItem

The `CartItem` component represents an individual product in the shopping cart. It displays the product details, including the image, title, description, price, discount, and rating. Users can adjust the quantity and remove items from the cart.

### 5. PriceCard

The `PriceCard` component shows the payment details on the cart page. It includes the subtotal, shipping cost, savings, and the total amount. Users can proceed to the payment page using the provided button.

### 6. FontAwesome

FontAwesome is a library that provides a collection of scalable vector icons. In this project, it's used to display icons like the trash icon in the remove button in the `CartItem` component.
